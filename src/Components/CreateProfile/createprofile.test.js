TO DO 
the form will: 
- click a button
- lots of inputs for different things
- if they click edit, it shows up all of their existing info
- if they are creating a profile, these inputs are empty 
- new members should be directed straight to the sign up form 
- initial state of all of them is held in one 
- conditional render = if this user name doesn't already exist, direct them to sign up
- if the user already exists, take them to their profile 
- initial state should be in an object 
- see one ben made earlier 
- make a form with a bunch of inputs in, to include uploading a profile pic 
- when it's filled in/changes are made onClick does the fetch (POST and PATCH)
- first time registers = POST 
- editing will be a = PATCH 
- onClick the POST or PATCH is complete and it will show the user their profile
- company = dropdown list to come from a fetch request of all conmpanies.
- in the company fetch bring back company name and company id 
- user will see the company name, but the value will be the id
- the user selects the name, but the id is used to render it on their profile
- include a button to add a company tbc. 


- TEST e.target.value from the input is the same value as is being rendered on screen 
- TEST what their typing is saved into initial this.state.
- TEST POST and PATCH ???
