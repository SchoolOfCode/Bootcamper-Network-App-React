### Faced with the problem of a distributed network of current bootcampers and alumni, team Jomellen decided to bring everyone together with our Bootcamper Network App. School of Code bootcampers past and present can all now login to the app and share their career progress with each other. This enables other bootcampers to see all SoC affiliated companies easily. Bootcampers can also share (privately, with only the SoC team) their job satisfaction rating, allowing the team to reach out to support the bootcamper with a new job hunt.
